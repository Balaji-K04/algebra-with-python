## Project
  
### Project 1 - Build a Multi-Function Calculator<br>
Your calculator should take input and do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Solve proportions</li>
<li>Solve for x in equations</li>
<li>Factor square roots</li>
<li>Convert decimals to fractions and percents</li>
<li>Convert fractions to decimals and percents</li>
<li>Convert percents to decimals and fractions</li>
</ul>

### Project 2 - Build a Graphing Calculator

Your calculator should do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li> Graph one or more functions</li>
<li>Create a table of (x,y) values</li>
<li>Shade above or below the line</li>
<li>Solve and graph a system of equations</li>
<li>Zoom in or out on a graph</li>
<li>Solve quadratic equations</li>
</ul>

### Project 3 - Build Three Math Games:

<ul>
<li>Scatter plot game<br>
 - Randomly generate points on a graph and the player has to input the (x,y) coordinates<br>
 - For added difficulty, make the graph larger</li>
<li>Algebra practice game<br>
 - Generate one-step and two-step problems with random integer values and the player has to input the answer<br>
 - Use positive and negative values. For added difficulty, make the numbers larger</li> 
<li>Projectile game<br>
 - Display a "wall" with random height and location. Player has to move sliders to adjust a parabolic path to clear the wall<br>
 - For added difficulty, make a second level where players enter a, b, and c without sliders</li>
 </ul>
 
 ### Project 4 - Build a Financial Calculator
 
Your calculator should do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Calculate annuity with monthly or continuous growth</li>
<li>Calculate monthly mortgage payment</li>
<li>Estimate retirement investment balance</li>
<li>Determine how long until an amount doubles, given the rate</li>
<li>Solve logarithmic equations</li>
<li>Convert to (and from) scientific notation</li>
</ul>

### Project 5 - Build a Data Graph Explorer
 
 Your script should do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Get a .csv file in three ways<br>
 - uploading it from the local computer<br>
 - getting a url from user input<br>
 - putting the url in the code<br>
</li>
<li>Use the Pandas library to save the .csv as a dataframe</li>
<li>Print headings and the first two rows</li>
<li>Store the column names as a list</li>
<li>Choose one or two columns and convert the data to Numpy arrays</li>
<li>Display data as a scatter plot or a line graph</li>
<li>Be able to do this for different column combinations, and interpret the graphs</li>
</ul>
